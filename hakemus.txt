There is already plenty of information about me in my cv I linked below so I`ll try not to repeat myself here.

Im Interested in your Junior software developer position for spring 2020, because it would be a great learning experience and I love a challenge!

I completed the pre-assignment project and here are the links for that:

1. website
- https://reactor-pre-assignment.herokuapp.com/
2. github repository for the source code and my thoughts about the project
- https://github.com/japiirainen/reactor-junior-pre
