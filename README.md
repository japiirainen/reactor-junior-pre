### To run the program locally just clone this repository to your computer and run the following command:

```
yarn && yarn start
```

### To run test suite:

```
yarn test
```

### Below some insight to my thought process about the problem and its requirements.

-  _Minimize the use of external dependencies. The goal of the assignment is to view how you solve the problems with the programming language, not how well you use package managers_. ðŸ™‚

So I decided to make this app using javascript so I ended up using nodejs for the server. There I decided to use express just to make the routes clean and easy. Thats pretty much the only dependency ( besides Jest for running tests ) I ended up using.

I decided to not use React, which is what I have used to write all my user interfaces to keep it minimal and to not complicate it for no reason since the UI needed was so minimal. And it was also a learning opportunity for me since I had really never done that before.

-  _Please keep the code simple and sweet. The main design goal of this program is maintainability. We value the simplicity and readability of the code over the number of features_.

I already talked about this but I followed these principles to my best ability!


TOD:
* Rewrite in TypeScript
* Rewrite ui in React. (or maybe try Vue3 or something) :-)
